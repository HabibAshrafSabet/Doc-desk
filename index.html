                    <h1>Making Health <br> Care Bettere Together</h1>
                    <p>The gap between science and culture is bridged by medicine. A crucial aspect of medical care is, therefore, the application of scientific knowledge to human health. Medical practice has evolved into a formal discipline with the passing years with the introduction of modern technologies, and people have seen a major increase in the quality of their lives. Doctors are one significant agent by whom this scientific knowledge is expressed.</p>
